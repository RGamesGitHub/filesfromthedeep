<h2>What this site is:</h2>
<p>This site is a small place where me and my friends<br>
make crappy stories or SCP bootlegs and upload them here.<br>
<br>
I made this on the 29th of November, on a friday.<br>
At the time, I was watching a video about some stupid things the SCP-Wiki did<br>
in 2018, causing a part of the community to splinter into the RPC Authority.<br>
<br>
I found it intresting, but when I finished watching it... I had a terrible idea.<br>
So, I made this website in like, a hour.
<br>
so yeah thats all</p>
