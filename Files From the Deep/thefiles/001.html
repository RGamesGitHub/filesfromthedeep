<p>Dear Dr. Jerold, <br>
I know you have been advising me to take my pills,<br>
but the thing under my bed still lurks there.<br>
I hear it shuffling under the bed, crawling and scratching<br>
the wood stucture of my bed.<br>
This is not a joke, please listen to me.<br>
<br>
Everyone I talk to tells me that I'm hallucinating and<br>
that I need to take those pills, but it does nothing.<br>
One day, it will make its way out and consume me.<br>
Please help me.<br>
please help me<br>
help me<br>
<b>help me</b><br>
<b>he</b> </p>
